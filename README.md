Organization Overview 

Name: Brew & Chill 

Brief history of the organization: 

The company has been operating for over 3 years providing quality coffee and keeping its customers happy and satisfied. It takes pride in giving back to its community by engaging in CSI projects and hiring from within the community it operates in. 

Mission and Vision Statement: 

The aim for this organization is to be the go-to place for customers seeking quality coffee. It is to create a safe space where people can gather to have a casual chat with their friends and families and enjoy working on their jobs while enjoying the best cup of coffee they have ever had in their lives. In the next 5 – 10 years we want to expand our services to other regions so that they can be accessible to all.

Website Goals and Objectives 

The goals for the coffee shop website are to get more customers and make the coffee shop accessible to all. With more customer intake that means the shop is going to make more profit. The website will also allow for the coffee shop to provide clarity on the prices and products that are being sold. 

 

The key performance indicators to measure success would be the retention of customers, how many leads convert into customers and if the profit of the shop increases or decreases 

Proposed Website Features and Functionality 

The website will include pages like the homepage which will briefly describe what the coffee shop is offering. The next page would be the about us page which dives into detail about what the coffee shop does. Another page would be the contact us page which will help the customer to know which numbers to dial if they were to enquire about something or want to purchase something. A product page will also be available so that customers will have clarity on the products being sold and their prices. The website will be user friendly and provide a great user experience. 

Design and User Experience 

The website will have a brown and white colour scheme; it will be easy to navigate through it, and the typography will guide the user through information highlighting the most important features/points that the user needs to know. The website will make use of call-to-actions that are eye catching and allow for a great user experience.

This considers the domain which will roughly cost around R100 – 300/year (Ravensdale Digital Services, 2025). Maintenance which might cost between the price range of R200-R600/month (mansadigitalagency.com, 2025). Logo design might cost between R350- R2,000 (mansadigitalagency, 2025) and E-commerce setup might be in the ranges of R12,000 – R30,000 depending on the complexity of the website.
